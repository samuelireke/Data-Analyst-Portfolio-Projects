# Promotional Analysis Project Description

Many businesses are very seasonal, and some of them make money during holidays like Christmas, Haloween, New Year's day, Easter, and Boxing day. In addition, they use sales promotions to increase the demand for or visibility of a product or service for several weeks during the year.

This project aims to analyze the historical data using time series analysis techniques, with promotion effect.

The data used consists of `weekly sales` and `price data` for  10 stores and 3 products. 

At the end, summarise the observations made from the analysis on which business decisions can be made.

As follow up to this project, I will also forecast the sales for next 50 weeks for one of the three products at one of the stores.
